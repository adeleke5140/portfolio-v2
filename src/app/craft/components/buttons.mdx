[SF Compute](https://sfcompute.com/) and [COSS UI](https://coss.com/ui/docs/components/alert-dialog) have buttons with a feeling of depth. They act like physical buttons.

<br />

<CraftContainer className="bg-white">
  <TastyButton />
</CraftContainer>

The key css properties are:

1. `border`
2. `background-image`
3. `box-shadow`
4. `transform`

The `background-image` and `box-shadow` properties with multiple color stops give the button its <em>embossed</em> appearance at rest. When pressed, the `scale`
transform creates a <em>debossed</em> effect, simulating how a physical button depresses under pressure.
