[SF Compute](https://sfcompute.com/) and [COSS UI](https://coss.com/ui/docs/components/alert-dialog) have buttons that make you want to click them. They resemble buttons from the physical world with a feeling of depth.

<br />

<CraftContainer className="bg-white">
  <TastyButton />
</CraftContainer>

The key css properties are:

1. `border`
2. `background-image`
3. `box-shadow`

`background-image` and `box-shadow` with multiple color stops give a feeling of depth.
