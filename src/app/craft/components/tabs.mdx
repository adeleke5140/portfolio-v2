title: Multi-Line Exclusion Tabs

Exclusion tabs inspired by [Paco](https://paco.me/craft/tabs) using [WAAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) and Clip-path. I extend it to support wrapped content with `flex-wrap` on the parent container.

You can use a `span` element and moves that based on the active item, but `CSS` is pretty powerful right now and there's so much we can do with it.
