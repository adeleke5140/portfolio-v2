title: Multi-Line Exclusion Tabs

Exclusion tabs inspired by [Paco](https://paco.me/craft/tabs) using [WAAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) and Clip-path. I extend it to support wrapped content with `flex-wrap` on the parent container.

You can use a `span` element and move that based on the active item, but `CSS` is pretty powerful right now and there's so much we can do with it. The trick is to use `clip-path` to create a mask that reveals only the active tab.

<CraftContainer>
  <Tabs />
</CraftContainer>

## How it works

To animate the `clip-path` across the horizontal axis, you have to measure how much you have to clip on the `left` and how much you have to clip on the `right`

```typescript
const { offsetLeft, offsetWidth } = activeTabElement;
const clipLeft = offsetLeft;
const clipRight = offsetLeft + offsetWidth;
```

Once you've gotten that, you slot the values into the `clip-path`

```typescript
container.style.clipPath = `inset(0 ${Number(100 - (clipRight / container.offsetWidth) * 100).toFixed()}% 0 ${Number((clipLeft / container.offsetWidth) * 100).toFixed()}% round 17px)`;
```

[Emil](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/the-magic-of-clip-path) has a great introduction to `clip-path`.

The trick to then getting it to work for `flex-wrap` containers is to figure out the `top` and `bottom` positions as well.

In this case
```typescript
const { offsetLeft, offsetWidth, offsetTop, offsetHeight } = activeTabElement
const clipLeft = offsetLeft
const clipRight = offsetLeft + offsetWidth
const clipBottom = offsetTop + offsetHeight
const clipTop = offsetTop
```

It wasn't intuitive at first but getting a pen and paper and drawing out a 4/4 rectangle helped simplify it.
