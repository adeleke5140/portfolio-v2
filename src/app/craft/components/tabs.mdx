title: Multi-Line Exclusion Tabs

Exclusion tabs inspired by [Paco](https://paco.me/craft/tabs) using [WAAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) and Clip-path. I extend it to support wrapped content with `flex-wrap` on the parent container.

You can use a `span` element and move that based on the active item, but `CSS` is pretty powerful right now and there's so much we can do with it. The trick is to use `clip-path` to create a mask that reveals only the active tab.

<CraftContainer>
  <Tabs />
</CraftContainer>

## How it works

To animate the `clip-path` across the horizontal axis, you have to measure how much you have to clip on the `left` and how much you have to clip on the `right`.

We add a `ref` to the activeTabElement and use that to get it's offsets.

```typescript
const { offsetLeft, offsetWidth } = activeTabElement;
const clipLeft = offsetLeft;
const clipRight = offsetLeft + offsetWidth;
```

Once you've gotten that, you slot the values into the `clip-path`. We are basically saying clip everything from the left of the element and everything after the right of the element.

```typescript
container.style.clipPath = `inset(0 ${Number(100 - (clipRight / container.offsetWidth) * 100).toFixed()}% 0 ${Number((clipLeft / container.offsetWidth) * 100).toFixed()}% round 17px)`;
```

[Emil](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/the-magic-of-clip-path) has a great introduction to the feature.

To make this work for `flex-wrap` containers, we need to figure out the `top` and `bottom` positions as well. With that we can by what percentage we have to clip.

In this case:

```typescript
const { offsetLeft, offsetWidth, offsetTop, offsetHeight } = activeTabElement
const clipLeft = offsetLeft
const clipRight = offsetLeft + offsetWidth
const clipBottom = offsetTop + offsetHeight
const clipTop = offsetTop
```

With that, our `clip-path` looks like this:

```typescript
const clipBottomValue = Number(
  100 - (clipBottom / container.offsetHeight) * 100).toFixed()

const clipTopValue = Number(
  (clipTop / container.offsetHeight) * 100).toFixed()

const clipRightValue = Number(
  100 - (clipRight / container.offsetWidth) * 100).toFixed()

container.style.clipPath = `inset(${clipTopValue}% ${clipRightValue}% ${clipBottomValue}% ${Number(
  (clipLeft / container.offsetWidth) * 100).toFixed()}% round 17px)`
```

It wasn't intuitive at first but getting a pen and paper and drawing out a 4/4 rectangle helped simplify it.

Thanks for Emil for the initial prototype.
