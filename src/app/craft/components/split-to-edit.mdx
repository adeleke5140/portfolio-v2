This recreation is inspired by the lovely work of [Nitish Khagwal](https://x.com/nitishkmrk/status/1962041664404390202). What inspired me to create it was the bounciness of the interaction.
It is this joyful and playful.

I am not satisfied with the duration of the border radius change. It occurs too early and therefore breaks the smooth transition.

I am currently working on it.
