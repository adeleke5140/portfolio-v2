I recently built a `fixed` movable navbar at Mastra. It had an interesting mask effect that I will write about soon, so that as you moved the navbar, you see what was behind it.

It worked as expected except for one problem. Everytime I refreshed, the navbar caused the page to jump to a random section. There were a couple of internal page links and each refresh auto-scrolled the page to that section. It was jarring.

The reason for the bug was the layout of my html.

Here is how it was setup:

```jsx
<body>
  <div>
      <FixedNav/>
      <OtherContent/>
  </div>
</body>
```

The fix was to take the nav out of the container for the rest of the content and move it to the body

```jsx
<body>
  <FixedNav/>
  <div>
    <OtherContent/>
  </div>
</body>
```

This wasn't immediately obvious to me as I spent a couple of minutes figuring out why the `fixed` positioning was breaking things.

I guess that's what the `Portal` element is useful for.

Next time I run into this same problem, this will be handy.

Thanks to **Dayo** for the tip.
