Color is a major way we experience the web. All of our adventures from reading hacker news, twitter, and everything in between are all color-full to an extent. Even the terminal uses color or the lack of color to convey information.

Here, I sought out to understand the intricacy of color on the web, in design, in computers and how they all relate to the human experinece. The human eye a vehicle of that experience.

Right now, it's premiliminary investigation into a couple of experiences and description of color I have seen on the web.

Here are a bunch of links that I have found Useful:

- [Linear's redesign](https://linear.app/now/how-we-redesigned-the-linear-ui)

Here Andreas Eldh discusses how LCH is "...the closes color spaces to the human eye" and how it benefits from percpetual uniformity meaning "...a red and a yellow color with lightness 50 will appear roughly equally light to the human eye"

> Reading Dan's blog on color provides much needed context to the quote above

I will read more on `LCH`

[Dan Hollick Config Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05vQ8HlU43Q)

There is also Dan's talk above where he talks about colors and how `tailwind` implemented the fresh palate. I have watched it but I didn't understand anything so a deep dive is required first and then I will go again.

I am currently reading [Dan's notes on Color][1] where he gives a rundown of the history of color, the physics and also the biology of color. A lot of it is a rough skim because going through the details of electromagnetic waves, electromagnetic spectrum, wavelength, energy, light, retina, rods, cones e.t.c would lead to a far longer essay.

For me though, what I have realized is that we tried to create computers, starting from the cathode ray tube that can stimualate the color our eyes are used to from EM radiation? so maybe that is that the perceptual uniformity [Andreas mentions](https://linear.app/now/how-we-redesigned-the-linear-ui), is all about.

Now some Light on what a color space is. Dan says:

> A color space is ... a specific organisation of colors so that they are reproducible.
