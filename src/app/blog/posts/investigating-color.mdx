Here are a bunch of links that I have found Useful:

[Linear's redesign](https://linear.app/now/how-we-redesigned-the-linear-ui)

Here Andreas Eldh discusses how LCH is "...the closes color spaces to the human eye" and how it benefits from perpetual uniformity meaning "...a red and a yellow color with lightness 50 will appear roughly equally light to the human eye"

I will read more on `LCH`

[Dan Hollick Config Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05vQ8HlU43Q)

There is also Dan's talk above where he talks about colors and how `tailwind` implemented the fresh palate. I have watched it but I didn't understand anything so a deep dive is required first and then I will go again.
