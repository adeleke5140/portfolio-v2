I wanted to play around with the `remote-mcp-server` from the `cloudflare` examples monorepo but didn't want to pull every example down. I just needed to access one folder.

Here is how I did it:
<br/>
```bash
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/cloudflare/ai.git

cd ai

git sparse-checkout init --cone

git sparse-checkout set demos/remote-mcp-server

git checkout main
```

and Voila!, I was good to go.
