We have all been there. Throwing `any` at function parameters and object keys because we couldn't be bothered to type it precisely. I did that for a recent project and it was a cop out.

The problem is that with `any`, we lose many of the benefits typescript offers us, in this case efficient code completion.

Today, I am gonna be discussing precise types and how they can make our code better.

## Example

The best way to illustrate this is with an example.

Suppose, we have a utility function `pluck`.

The function of `pluck` is to pull out all the values for a single field in an object. The objects are members of an array.
Properly typing the `pluck` function can help in making sure that we only use existing keys
that exist in the object.

I am going to create 4 variants of the `pluck` utility function. It would range from untyped to typed.

The pluck function without any type(no-pun intended) is this:

```typescript
function pluck(records, key) {
  return records.map((record) => record[key])
}
```

Here the function is untyped and while it works at runtime, it opens up a can of errors.
We aren't sure that the key we use actually exist, which means we might be trying to access a property not present. The return type is also an `any[]`. It is still valid `TS` code but without any benefits.

```typescript
function pluck(records: any[], key: string): any[] {
  return records.map((record) => record[key])
}
```

Here in the second version, it is slightly better but the `string` type is still too broad.
Remember that this string could also not exists on the object we need to access. The `any` type is also problematic.

```typescript
function pluck<T>(records: T[], key: string) {
  return records.map((record) => record[key])
}
```

We make the function a generic so that it can infer the specific `type` of the array. The type checker complains.

We cannot use a `string` key to index type `unknown`.

The problem here still persists and this is because string is still broad. It is **stringly typed**. The return type is also still `any[]`

```typescript
function pluck<T>(records: T[], key: keyof T) {
  return records.map((record) => record[key])
}
```

We are making some progress here. We constrain the key so that it is only an existing key on the object. Typescript infers the return type.

If you mouse over the function, the return type is `T[keyof T][]`
In this case, if there are four keys with values of type `number` and `string`, the compiler infers the returned `array` as a `string` or number `array`.

It can be better.

```typescript
function pluck<T, K extends keyof T>(record: T[], key: K): T[K][] {
  return records.map((record) => record[key])
}
```

Perfecto. In this final function, we have a generic function with two parameters. `T` and `K` which denotes the object and a key on the object. The second parameter K is a subset of `keyof T` Using this variant, we get straightfoward autocomplete of the known properties in the object.

Here is an concrete example:

```typescript
type RecordingType = 'studio' | 'live'

type RecordType = {
  artist: string
  title: string
  releaseDate: Date
  recordingType: RecordingType
}

const recordsArr: RecordType[] = [
  {
    artist: 'Ed Sheeran',
    title: 'Perfect',
    releaseDate: new Date(),
    recordingType: 'studio',
  },
  {
    artist: 'zedd feat Jon Bellion',
    title: 'Beautiful now',
    releaseDate: new Date(),
    recordingType: 'live',
  },
  {
    artist: 'Zinolessky',
    title: 'Many things',
    releaseDate: new Date(),
    recordingType: 'studio',
  },
]

const artistArr = pluck(recordsArr, 'title')
```

## Conclusion

Typescript offers us a lot quality of life improvement for DX. Even though it can be tempting to throw any all over the place, using precise types benefits far outweighs the trouble of thinking a bit more about our types.
