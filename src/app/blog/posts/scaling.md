Could you possibly scale prematurely?

I have been thinking through scaling in systems. Vertical and horizontal scaling for when there is a perceived bottleneck in the current system. The former scaling by adding more compute and the latter by increasing the amount of available servers.

I do wonder though if developers might be prone to premature scaling. Similar to how premature abstractions and premature optimizations can exist in a system. Premature optimization is optimization that is done without sufficient measurement and a full exploration of all that's faulty with a current system.

I imagine a simple server with a single database, before adding more compute, could it perhaps be worth spending time to improve async `I/O`, database profiling and pooling and other bottlenece that exist within the system. If those bottlnecks have been introduced as a result of added complexity, working and sorting it out first of all could improve the performance.

After that would be profiling, which should then provide sufficient information that scaling is now warranted in order to make things performant.
