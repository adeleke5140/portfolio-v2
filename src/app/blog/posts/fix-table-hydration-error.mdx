## Introduction

NextJS hydration error is one of those errors that are bound to happen when working with the framework.

## The Problem

After writing the syntax for my HTML table, NextJS threw the error:

```typescript
Error: Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server.

Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching <td> in <td>.

[See more info here:](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error)
```

I was lost. I followed the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for creating the table. MDN is the gold standard for web dev doc so I was sure I had done everything right.

The syntax was correct, the DOM elements was in the right order...but were they?

The DOM nesting was in fact not correct. The faulty code was a line in the `tbody`:

```html
<tbody>
  <td>
    <td>Kehinde Adeleke</td>
  </td>
<tbody>
```

I had a nested a `td` in another `td` which led to the hydration error. After removing the nested `td`, the error was fixed.

This fix looks easy now but this frustrated me for 3hrs. Because of that, I decided to do some more research.

## Why this happened

I wasn't satisfied with just solving this. I wanted to get to the root of the problem.

The [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/tables.html#the-td-element) spec on `td` element was a good place to start.

The `td` element can only be used in a context where it is the child of a `tr` element. This context is a non-normative description of the `td` element.

> [Non-normative in software context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/non-normative)

NextJS renders the HTML statically on the server first and I hypothesize that `SSR` cannot work with improper tag nesting as per the spec above.

Due to this, the runtime throws an error - honestly this should be a server error that properly specifies what the error is. A better error message of `invalid DOM Nesting` would aid developers - certainly would have aided me - debug the problem faster.

> Update: There is some improvements that Tim from the Vercel team described [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/24519#issuecomment-1439915463). The component stack is included which now helps

There is a second part to this. The Browser still constructs a table. I believe the client tries as much as it can to still create a working document even if the tags aren't ordered properly.

If you construct a `HTML` table like this:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Contact</th>
    <th>Country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
    <td>Maria Anders</td>
    <td>Germany</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
    <td>Francisco Chang</td>
    <td>Mexico</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

Your Client will display it alright but NextJS will throw an error in the format:

```typescript
Unhandled Runtime Error

Error: Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server.

Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching <tr> in <table>.
```

The error is different from the one above but the root cause is the same. The DOM nesting is incorrect.

The solution is to include the `<thead/>` and `<tbody/>` tags. This is the correct way to construct a table:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">The table header</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The table body</td>
      <td>with two columns</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

## Conclusion

Next time you run into an error like this, check your DOM nesting. It might be the cause of the error.
