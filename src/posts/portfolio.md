## Introduction 

I have had the same portfolio for quite a while now. I made it in a hurry because a recruiter requested for it. It was wasn't shabby; I think it's one of the best websites I've made. but, it didn't reflect my personality.
The design was from a designer I found on dribble. They told me I could use it so far I credited them. You can check out the site [here](https://kendev.netlify.app/)

It worked out okay, but the recruiter ghosted me which sucked. Since then, I've 
thought about making v2 of my portfolio.

v2 would reflect me more and give people an inkling into my inner life.
