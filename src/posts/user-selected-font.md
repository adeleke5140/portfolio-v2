## Introduction

Text legibility matters a whole lot to me. Whenever I need to read a book on Apple books,
an article on Matter, or a blog post on Substack, I always ensure that the font is one that is legible. Easy on my eyes.
Legible enough that I don't need to struggle while reading it.

I want that experience to be on this site as well.
At the moment, the font is set to **DM MONO** which looks very good as a header font but is not the best for body text.

I want to change that. I want a more legible font pairing but I haven't been able to find one that I like. A lot of good fonts out there
are legible but they don't look good. I want a font that is legible and looks good.

So right now, I have decided that instead of finding the "right font", I am gonna allow explorers of this site choose their own fonts.
Basically, a choose your adventure.]

## How to choose your font

You can select your prefered font from the toggle button on the top right corner of the site.

## font options
* default: **DM Mono**
* Pairing 2: **Inter**
* Pairing 3: **Satoshi** and **erode**

## Conclusion

Right now, my effort would be on making the font toggle work properly without harming the site's performance.
My goal is to create **my personal garden** that is also accessible. I am gonna be adding more options to the font toggle as time goes on.

thank you for reading.
