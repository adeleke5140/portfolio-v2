## Introduction

I don't want to fail.

One thing I most especially don't want to fail at is my software engineering career.
Yet if I don't want to fail, I need to really take the time to introspect.

Introspect? why?
Because I believe that without regular assessment of where I am, I cannot get to my destination.

## The motivation 

I am once again out of a job. I wasn't fired but because of certain circumstances,
I would not be receiving a wage. This bothers me a lot and especially my finacial situation.


What's worse is that the job market is especially tough. Is it a recession? is it 
overhiring that needs to be corrected?, I have no idea. At least, what I know is that jobs have been competitive and right now, even more so. After all the layoffs, I have a primal fear that it might take exceedingly long before anyone takes a chance of hiring a junior.

It is frankly anxiety inducing. It can take away my little joys if I am not careful because frankly this is all my eggs in the only basket I've got.

I also identify the fact that I still suck in respect to my coding skills. I am not yet where I need to be. I still need to increase the grind. 


What then can I do? 


## What to do

What can I do? What steps can I take to whether this storm. Being in a frenzy and panicking certainly doesn't help. what then is the right step.

The right step is the step that moves me 1% forward.

That is the step I have decided to take and I will explain. 
Of course, it is a fact that a lot of quite negative things are happening in the tech industry. there is one thing I can focus on though: my response to it.

I can decide to spend every waking day worrying but I will choose to keep moving.
This means that: I will revamp my resume, build more side projects, keep connecting to folks and continue learning.

In the turmoil, I will make sure my focus doesn't waver. The focus to be an exceptional engineer that doesn't back down from a challenge.

I don't have the 2yrs or 3yrs experience, but I will bring what only I can provide: my uniqueness as an engineer.

That is my resolve and my commitment. My resolve to be better and do better. My resolve to not scuttle like a rat into the shadow. Rather, I will keep charting a path forward.

Till I get that stable job.

## How to do it

I will make sure that I do not neglect my fundamentals. Nothing is worth glossing over with regards to fundamental web technologies HTML, CSS, JS. The libraries I use are tools worth mastering: React, RTK, Tailwind, Vite e.t.c

When I see an exciting project or an interesting portfolio, that is a cue to be challenged positively instead of being intimadated.

> If this person can put in the work, why can't I?

I will take the courses, read the books, challenge myself over and over and over again.

> Is it Data structures and algorithms? I will learn it \
> Is it technical interview prep? I will practice it \
> Is it JS fundamentals? I will review it

My commitment to learning is my commitment to growing as an engineer.
No stone will be left unturned in this exploration of knowledge.

Because this is just the start of the journey.

## Conclusion

I wrote this on because I wanted to document my current challenge and how I was gonna solve it. My approach to navigating this raging storm in the tech industry.

I will do what I can.

**Onwards!!**
